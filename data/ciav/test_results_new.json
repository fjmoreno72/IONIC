                "Name": "NBWF Ed. 1 Radio Silence Verification",
                "Purpose": "Verification of Radio Silence capability of STANAG 5630 NBWF Ed.1.\\n\\nRadio Silence here means that the radio informs other radios before entering into radio silence and can join again the network when leaving radio silence without loss of connectivity.",
                "Precondition": "RF signals are transmitted between the DUTs (Devices Under Test) over the air:\\n\\n*   Every DUT-T (transmitter device) must verify the maximum power (including attenuators) to be used during the test case. Its power must not exceed this power.\\n*   Every DUT-R (receiver device) must verify that its input has an attenuator that makes the device sustain the power from any DUT-T limiting its power as specified in the previous bullet.\\n*   If it is necessary to modify the transmission power and reception attenuation for certain combination of DUT-T and DUT-R, then a plan should have been established and be followed during the test process.\\n\\nA DUT-R that is broken and not capable of receiving RF signals, is excluded from the relevant tests because interoperability cannot be tested.\\n\\nThe RF carrier frequency (range) shall have been decided between participant in advance so that all participants support the frequency.",
                "ValidationCriteria": "**Success:** Nodes that are not in radio silence are informing correctly the network about nodes in radio silence and the network is maintained.\\n\\n**Fail:** Break of connectivity when nodes are entering and leaving radio silence.\\n\\n<br>",
                "Execution": "State for each test step if your solution conforms to the standard.\\n\\n<br>",

IFF information is the primary means of co-operative identification within NATO, although it is rarely used as the sole source of identification. Due to inherent limitations of IFF systems, the Rules Of Engagement (ROE) customarily require other forms of identification in conjunction with IFF identification before a target can be engaged.

IFF services can only distinguish between a friend (with a working transponder) and a non-friend (without such a transponder). IFF information is the primary means of co-operative identification within NATO, although it is rarely used as the sole source of identification. Due to inherent limitations of IFF systems, the Rules Of Engagement (ROE) customarily require other forms of identification in conjunction with IFF identification before a target can be engaged. Other forms of identification to consider are Visual identification, Track origin, ESM and SIGINT, Tactical Data Links or FFT among others.",
