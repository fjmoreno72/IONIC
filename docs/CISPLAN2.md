CIS Plan Component Evaluation
Based on my analysis of the files, I can identify the main functionality and purpose of each component in the CIS Plan system. These files appear to be part of a version 2.0 refactoring of the CIS Plan UI, which aligns with the memories about previous refactoring efforts.

1. cis_api_2.js
Main Functionality: API interaction layer for the CIS Plan 2.0 system.

Provides a CISApi2 namespace with methods to interact with backend API endpoints
Uses a GUID-based API structure for entity management
Key functions include:
fetchCISPlanData(): Retrieves the entire CIS Plan hierarchy
getEntity(): Fetches a specific entity by GUID
getEntitiesByType(): Gets all entities of a specific type
createEntity(), updateEntity(), deleteEntity(): CRUD operations for entities
getEntityPath(): Gets the hierarchical path to an entity
getSecurityClassifications(): Retrieves security classifications
This file centralizes all API calls, following the pattern mentioned in your memories about extracting API functions to improve maintainability.

2. cis_details_2.js
Main Functionality: Manages the details panel on the right side of the UI.

Provides a CISDetails2 namespace for handling element details display
Manages the DOM elements for the details panel
Key functions include:
updateDetails(): Updates the panel with element-specific information
renderElementDetails(): Delegates to the appropriate renderer based on element type
showEditDialog() and showDeleteDialog(): Handles edit and delete operations
clearDetails(): Resets the panel when no element is selected
showLoading() and showError(): Provides feedback during operations
This component is responsible for displaying detailed information about the selected element and providing edit and delete functionality.

3. cis_detail_renderers_2.js
Main Functionality: Specialized renderers for different entity types in the details panel.

Provides a CISDetailRenderers2 namespace with type-specific rendering functions
Contains specialized renderers for each entity type in the hierarchy:
Mission Networks
Network Segments
Security Domains
HW Stacks
Assets
Network Interfaces
GP Instances
SP Instances
Each renderer displays type-specific properties and relationships
Some renderers fetch additional data asynchronously (e.g., security classification details)
This file follows the pattern in your memories about displaying human-readable names alongside technical IDs for various entity types.

4. cis_tree_2.js
Main Functionality: Manages the hierarchical tree view in the left panel of the UI.

Provides a CISTree2 namespace for tree rendering and interaction
Handles the creation, selection, and navigation of tree nodes
Key functions include:
renderTree(): Renders the entire CIS Plan hierarchy
Specialized render functions for each entity type (e.g., renderMissionNetworks(), renderNetworkSegments())
createTreeNode(): Creates tree nodes with consistent styling
selectTreeNode(): Handles node selection and deselection
navigateUp(): Implements upward navigation in the hierarchy
restoreExpandedNodes(): Preserves expanded state during refresh
This component implements the hierarchical rendering pattern mentioned in your memories, with proper parent reference tracking and event handling.

5. cis_util_2.js
Main Functionality: Utility functions shared across the CIS Plan components.

Provides a CISUtil2 namespace with reusable helper functions
Key functions include:
getEntityIcon(): Returns the appropriate icon for an entity type
getEntityTypeName(): Provides human-readable names for entity types
createElement(): Helper for DOM element creation
findEntityByGuid(): Searches for entities in the data structure
styleChildContainer(): Applies consistent styling to tree nodes
createElementCard(): Creates cards for the center panel
getEntityDisplayName(): Formats entity names for display
This file centralizes common functionality like entity type labels and UI styling, as mentioned in your memories about code refactoring.

Overall Architecture
The CIS Plan 2.0 system follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

API Layer (cis_api_2.js): Handles all backend communication
Tree View (cis_tree_2.js): Manages the hierarchical navigation tree
Details Panel (cis_details_2.js + cis_detail_renderers_2.js): Shows and edits entity details
Utilities (cis_util_2.js): Provides shared functionality across components
This architecture aligns with the refactoring efforts mentioned in your memories, particularly the focus on modularization, centralization of common functionality, and improved maintainability.
